# Blog-Website
A simple Blog-Website I created while learning Web Development.
It uses mongoose for database.
Should have mogoDB installed in your local computer and should be running it to use the website.
To run the website - 
a. Run mondoDB using mongod command.
b. The website is hosted at port 3000.
c. Run the command "node app.js"
d. In browser run the url "localhost:3000"
